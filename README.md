vim config
==========

Description
-----------

Vim configuration for front-end development.

Usage
-----

Place the content of the repo to `.vim` directory inside your home directory.
But first, remove your `.vimrc` file if it is present.

Run `vim`. Wait for the plugin manager to download plugins (it takes place 
only once).

Enjoy vim.

By the way, arrow keys are disabled to cultivate proper vim habits.
`ESC` key is also disabled, in favor of `jk` as a faster alternative, hehehe.
