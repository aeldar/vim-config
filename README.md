vim config
==========

Description
-----------

Vim configuration for front-end development.

Dependencies
------------

- `curl` should be installed and be available globally in `PATH`
- `node` is good to have (can be installed later)
- full version of `vim` should be installed (not just `vim.tiny`, which is the defaults in ubuntu)

Usage
-----

Place the content of the repo to `.vim` directory inside your home directory.
But first, remove your `.vimrc` file if it is present.

Run `vim`. Wait for the plugin manager to download plugins (it takes place 
only once).

Enjoy vim.

By the way, arrow keys are disabled to cultivate proper vim habits.
`ESC` key is also disabled, in favor of `jk` as a faster alternative, hehehe.

Known issues
------------

On first run the error message about the absence of `codedark` theme is shown.
Just ignore it. The theme will be downloaded automatically.
